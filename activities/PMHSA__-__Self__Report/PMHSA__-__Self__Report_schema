It is important to understand that rating scales alone do not determine a diagnosis. For example, if the attention problems subscale score comes out in the clinically significant range on a behavior rating scale, it does not necessarily mean that this individual is suffering from ADHD. It does, however, indicate that they reported symptoms commonly associated with ADHD. Further clinical evaluation and attention would then be recommended, unless the range of symptoms addressed by the scale is already being addressed in treatment."
